# CS-305

1) Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company. They specialize in developing future plans for savings, investments, insurance, and retirements. The problems that they are wanting solved, revolve around having their API more secure for outside threats. I was needed to complete a vulnerability assessment report that will further help the Global Rain team find a mitigation strategy for these vulnerabilities. 

2) I thought I caught on quick to finding and reviewing the code when searching for vulnerabilities. I also thought I did well in going through the dependency checks and providing the solutions to those vulnerabilities that were found.

3) The most difficult part of the assessment for me was finding the which areas of security were being impacted, and apart of which software. This is something I will have to do more of in order to progress at it. It just took me a long time to go throught it.

4) Their werem many approaches that I attempted to increase security. For Artemis Financial, using the hashing algorithm to encrpty passwords before storing them should be a very important layer of security in order to protect the customers data. This will ensure protection from attackers trying to compromise the customer and the company.

5) I went through the process of testing the application by running a new dependency check. After I refactored the code to ensure that the new vulnerabilities did not show up. This of course doesn not guarantee that everything is secure, but it helps us see the modifications that have been made to the system.

6) I would say the biggest resource would have been the NVD. This was and will be very helpful for any past, present, and future assignments I will have. This helped me be able to understand and follow through the dependency checks in order to know how to proceed.

7) I believe the manual review section showcased my knowledge and skills the best. It showed my ability to review code, and interpret vulnerabilities that the code had.
